hello world!

i'm in the process of constructing this site, so pardon the dust

in the meantime, here are some facts:
I'm a computer science PhD student at the University of Chicago. 
In 2020, I graduated from the University of Minnesota with a BS in computer science, a BS in mathematics, and a minor in astrophysics.
I wanted to minor in art but had no room in my schedule.
I have random bouts of productivity and inspiration that strike at any time and inconsistently, so I may forget that I made this site.
